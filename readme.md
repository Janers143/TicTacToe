# TicTacToe Game with AI

This is a TicTacToe game made in python with the objective of learning to use and apply the 
[Minimax Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax). I have used the 
[Pygame module](https://www.pygame.org/news) to make the interface. You can see how to install it 
[here](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted).

## How to run it

In order to run this program you can do it from a command prompt to run it. You need to go to the folder
containing this project and run the following command :

```
$ python main_game.py
```
